Executive Summary

We’re making a mobile game called Ideal Journey. In the game, a series of commands are defined and the player must follow
the commands received. This app provides entertainment value to the users in an effort to distract them from the monotony of real
life. Should players perform the wrong task or fail to take any action, the game ends.

Some of the key functions we intend to include are a persistent scoring system, a login system, and taking advantage of the 
mobility and versatility of the mobile platform. The mobile component will communicate with the server component in order to 
achieve successful login and persistent non-local high-score functionality.

Targeted Users

Our target audience includes adolescents and young adults who own smartphones and desire more kinetic interactions, because they 
like the sense of achievement associated with overcoming an obstacle. They will then continue to use the application due to the 
nature of the ever-changing game, which provides a large amount of replay value along with a sense of development in skill. This 
linear progression and sense of achievement are the main draws of our game.

Technical Summary

We intend to use Unity to develop our project. For our planned technology stack we will be using C# and Unity’s 2018.1.0f2 build on
the frontend, and Node.JS, Express.JS and MongoDB for the backend.

Some of the features we plan to implement include:
1.	Non-standard input to take advantage of mobile: swipes, taps, shakes, turns, flips, etc.
2.	Persistent score tracking to keep track of your previous best(s) and global best(s)
3.	Using the accelerometer and gyroscope to gauge success

Some of the goals that we would like to include, but that may lack feasibility within the given timeframe are:
1.	Someone with a cool voice for instruction SFX
2.	Haptic feedback to indicate successful completion of a task
3.	Multiplayer in some form (Perhaps a pass-the-phone party mode)
4.	Easter Eggs
